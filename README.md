# HNG 6.0 Internship - Task 2
Task 2 - Creation of a Complete Login System, equiped with a signup page.
This project was designed and created by teamKronos. 

# BitLender
BitLender is an online, peer-to-peer lending platform that helps individals save, invest and also get matching loans based on activity level 

## About Project
This is a BitLender login and registration page. At start, visitors are directed to a login page that prompts them to input their login details. Once the login detail of visitors correlates with that found on the mysqli database, they are logged in and redirected to a landng page. New visitors (those whose details are not found in the database) are redirected to a registratiohn page.

## Tools Used
During the creation of the project, the major lang used was PHP and MYSQLi. Javascript was used to test the users aunthetication at the frontend.

## App Host
After completion of the project, the app was hosted on Heroku. Furthermore, code was refactored to an API base and hosted on a shared hosting platform which can be found <a href = "http://junicodefire-private.000webhostapp.com/">here</a>

## Contributing
This app can be run locally using server applications such as XAMPP (for windows systems ) or MAPP (for Mac systems). To run and test the application, kindly download XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/ or MAPP from https://www.mamp.info/en/. Installation process can be gotten from https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-install-mamp-on-your-mac/ OR  https://pureinfotech.com/install-xampp-windows-10/. Kindly note that the database has to be imported to the server with the name "hng_loginsystem" to avoid errors when connecting to the database.
Also, php has to be installed in the system to enable running of the php files on the browser tabs. To download and install php kindly use this link https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-install-php-on-windows/ (for Windows PC) https://tecadmin.net/install-php-macos/ (for Mac PC) https://tecadmin.net/install-php-7-on-ubuntu/ (for Ubuntu). Make sure the php is running on your system by typing php -S localhost:4000 in the command prompt or terminal (for Ubuntu and Mac)
As soon as the server is running, clone the repo to the server file and you will be able to access the app on your local machine. 

Happy coding...
